            <div>
                <p>Growing up as the kid of enlisted parents has given me unique insights, and experiences. The constant moving and environment changes made sure I always had to adapt to different situations. Constantly having the feeling of starting at the bottom rung had become the norm for me. However, I always managed to persevere and adapt to my environment. Like a chameleon I was able to blend in, almost to the point where it seemed I was from there. This ability to adapt has been something I carried with me and strive to improve. I held various odd jobs over the years with which I used my adaptability to understand and do those jobs well. Through adaptation I had become something like a jack-of-all-trades, also what I will be referring to as a joatman. I realized through adaptation I was gaining skills that I can carry with me to other jobs. Things like time management, workplace communication, how to manage and be managed, and various other general skills that can be applied in various fields.Adaptation was something I used to take for granted, and I believe most do now. Everyone has the ability to adapt, it's a dynamic quality that makes us truly human. It wasn't until I actually became conscious of this fact and started improving. In order to improve my ability to adapt I started diving head-first into odd jobs, and projects that could be considered over my head. That is where I spent most of my early adult life doing. Gaining knowledge and skills that I could carry on and use in the future. This was only possible due to my ability top quickly adapt to almost any situation, and is something I pride myself on.</p>
                <p>I used to dislike the idea of becoming a jack-of-all-trades, to me it seemed if that were true then my professional value would plummet since I do not excel in any particular thing. I eventually learned that the value comes from being able to suit any role. This mentality is what I use to peruse cross-training in any profession I held. I never settle for being excellent at one thing, Iâ€™d rather train to be good at a multitude of things, for when there is a situation that has slack to be picked up, I can be the one to do it. This is how I leaned the more I know how to do in a given job, the more valuable I am. That is when I started understanding that being a joatman is not such a bad break.I plan to keep applying what I have learned, and what I will learn by being adaptable and a jack-of-all-trades to my future endeavors. I have been using my adaptability by learning various roles in the software field. From being an analyst, eliciting requirements from clients, all the way to maintenance, near the end of the software lifecycle. Where being a jack-of-all-trades has proven itself useful, where by learning various programming languages feels natural. This cements my philosophy of being an adaptable joatman, and I will continue to carry this with me as I move thorough my professional pathway. </p>
